            But before the Commonwealth Games, there were these long camps, ammunition was made available… So, that was a significant change in strategy, which was seen and felt on the ground and felt by athletes because they suddenly had this opportunity to be in this organised training camp sort of environment for a long period of time.”</p>

            <p>At the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt, US President Donald Trump called Pakistan's Army Chief his
                "favourite Field Marshal" as he thanked him and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for their role in bringing
                peace to Gaza.<br>

                "Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and I have to say my favourite Field Marshal from Pakistan, who is
                not here, but the Prime Minister is here," Trump said, addressing the gathering aimed at signing a
                ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas as a visibly awkward Pakistani leader stood behind him.<br>

                Moments later, the US president praised India, calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "very good friend"
                who has done a "fantastic job". Then, in an awkward moment for the Pakistani premier, Trump turned
                towards Sharif and asked, "I think that Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together,
                right?".<br>

                Caught off guard, Sharif smiled uneasily as Trump continued, "They are, they are... and they're two
                great... I tell you... leaders, great leaders as far as I'm concerned."<br>

                Later, taking the podium, Sharif thanks Trump for 'stopping India-Pak war'. The Pakistan PM said he
                would like to again nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for "saving millions of lives not only in
                South Asia but also in the Middle East".<br>

                "This is because he has brought not only peace in South Asia, saved the lives of millions of people
                there, and today here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieving peace in Gaza is saving millions of lives in the
                Middle East," Sharif added.<br>

                Islamabad, on several occasions, has backed Trump's claim of ending the military conflict between India
                and Pakistan in May. The Sharif government even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, even though
                India has consistently maintained that the understanding on cessation of hostilities with Pakistan was
                reached following direct talks between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two
                militaries.<br>

                India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and
                Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.<br>

                India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense
                cross-border drone and missile strikes. </p>

        <p>The number of dengue patients in Ghaziabad is rising sharply, while new cases of malaria are showing a downward trend. 
            According to a report from the Health Department, dengue cases have increased from 59 to 210 in just one and a half months. On September 1, there were only 59 cases, but within 45 days, 141 new patients were identified.
          Most patients have recovered, but several continue to suffer from fever and viral symptoms. Six patients are currently admitted to government and private hospitals, with many showing low platelet counts. Despite continuous door-to-door inspections under the Communicable Disease Control Campaign, dengue mosquito larvae are still being found in residential areas. Notices have been issued to 123 residents on Tuesday and 78 on Wednesday for poor sanitation.</p>

            <p>Japan is facing a nationwide flu outbreak.Japan has officially declared a nationwide influenza epidemic, after a sudden and early surge in flu cases sent over 4,000 people to hospitals and shut down dozens of schools. <br>
                Experts say the outbreak has arrived five weeks earlier than usual, signalling a shift in how the virus is spreading across Asia.

            <p>‘Photon catcher’ can detect smallest unit of energy and is seen as paving way for major projects like quantum communication networks.
                The feat was achieved by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province and reported last Friday by Science and Technology Daily, a publication of China’s Ministry of Science and Technology. 
                However, optical cameras are inherently limited: they cannot operate at night and are easily obstructed by cloud cover, fog or other adverse weather conditions. In real combat scenarios, military commanders place greater trust in radar satellites, which can function reliably around the clock and under all weather.

            <p>Indian cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma began their final preparations for the upcoming ODI series against Australia by training together in the first net session on Thursday (Oct 16). <br>
                Both the players have arrived in Australia in the first batch of the Indian squad, gearing up for their first international series since winning the Champions Trophy, earlier this year.
                 The former Indian captains batted for about 30 minutes each during the training session.
                <br>
                  Soon after arriving in Perth, senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma immediately got to work, spending a lot of time in the nets during the Indian team's first practice before the ODI series against Australia, which starts in Perth on Sunday.
                <br>
                 Rohit and Kohli, who are only available in the 50-over format and last represented India in the Champions Trophy in February and March, are the center of attention in the series.
                <br>
                In the nets, the two former captains of India batted for about 30 minutes. On Wednesday and Thursday, the Indian team arrived in Perth in two groups for the three-ODI and five-T20 white-ball tour that begins on October 19.

            <p>
                After a relatively quiet morning here at the White House, it's suddenly buzzing with activity after Trump's post that he's on a call with Vladimir Putin. <br>
                For days now, Trump has been teasing that he may send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. These missiles have an extremely long range of approximately over 1,000 miles (1600km), which could, potentially, give Kyiv additional ability to strike deep into Russia and fundamentally alter the war.
                Over the last several weeks, there's been a notable shift in tone from the White House regarding Ukraine. Trump has said he's "disappointed" in Putin, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed that Moscow could face "costs" for continuing the war.
               And at the UN General Assembly in September, Trump said that he believes that Russia is a "paper tiger" and that Ukraine could ultimately take back the territory it has so far lost - an abrupt U-turn in US policy that caught many by surprise.
           <br>
              We're still waiting to hear how the conversation with Putin went, and what message Trump conveyed to his Russian counterpart.
              The next update is likely to come from Trump's Truth Social account again.

            <p>Washington:
Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have sharply increased their use of artificial intelligence to deceive people online and mount cyberattacks against the United States, according to new research from Microsoft.
This July, the company identified more than 200 instances of foreign adversaries using AI to create fake content online, more than double the number from July 2024 and more than ten times the number seen in 2023.
The findings, published Thursday in Microsoft's annual digital threats report, show how foreign adversaries are adopting new and innovative tactics in their efforts to weaponise the internet as a tool for espionage and deception.
America's adversaries, as well as criminal gangs and hacking companies, have exploited AI's potential, using it to automate and improve cyberattacks, to spread inflammatory disinformation and to penetrate sensitive systems. AI can translate poorly worded phishing emails into fluent English, for example, as well as generate digital clones of senior government officials.
